**Radioactive Aerosols in Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flow**

An NDA PhD Bursary Scheme Project undertaken as a part of the EPSRC Aerosol Science CDT.

**Welcome**

Hello and welcome to my Github page. This page is intended as a repository of code produced as a part of my PhD project,
'Radioactive Aerosols in Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flow'. I will be investigating the transport and deposition mechanics of radioactive aerosols,
specifically in the context of the use of laser ablation to decontaminate radioactively contaminated surfaces encountered during the nuclear
decommissioning process. 

The code so far is intended to be used to investigate the microscale dynamics of individual and/or small groups of particles. 
It is very much a work in progress. Please feel free to contact me at gregory.marsden@bristol.ac.uk with your thoughts, comments, and constructive criticisms.

**How to Use**

This code was developed in Python via jupyter notebook. To use, copy and paste the code into a new Python 3 ipykernel notebook (current version 6.4.8).

**Results so Far**

So far, I have been modelling the transport of a point particle. I have assigned this point particle the properties of an Fe2O3 (iron oxide) particle,
5 micrometres in diameter. This is as this it is expected that the bulk composition of aerosols generated by laser ablation will correspond to the material 
being ablated (in this case, I have chosen steel). This can be adjusted to add complexity and/or match experimental results in the future.

I have chosen a fixed velocity of 1 m/s as a result of discussions with members of the National Nuclear Ventilation Forum (NNVF). 1 m/s is often chosen as
the air speed of ventilation systems as it thought of as being fast enough to provide adequate ventilation, and slow enough to avoid the presence of large-scale turbulent eddies. This value also matches the flow of a Krantz reusable filter (1 m^3/s) through a 1 m^2 square cross-section pipe.

The movement of the aerosol particle is modelled in 3D using the 4th Order Runge Kutta (RK) mechanism. Its results converge on the expected terminal velocities, as can be seen below.

Note that the terminal velocity in the z-direction is 0 m/s; my code outputs a value of 2.28e-140 m/s after 200,000 time steps. This may be indicative of the inherent error in the RK operator, or is perhaps an artifact of machine precision.
