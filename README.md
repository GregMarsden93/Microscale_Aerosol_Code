**Radioactive Aerosols in Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flow**

An NDA PhD Bursary Scheme Project undertaken as a part of the EPSRC Aerosol Science CDT.

**Welcome**

Hello and welcome to my Github page. This page is intended as a repository of code produced as a part of my PhD project,
'Radioactive Aerosols in Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flow'. I will be investigating the transport and deposition mechanics of radioactive aerosols,
specifically in the context of the use of laser ablation to decontaminate radioactively contaminated surfaces encountered during the nuclear
decommissioning process. 

The code so far is intended to be used to investigate the microscale dynamics of individual and/or small groups of particles.
It is very much a work in progress.

**How to Use**

This code was developed in Python via jupyter notebook. To use, copy and paste the code into a new Python 3 ipykernel notebook (current version 6.4.8).
